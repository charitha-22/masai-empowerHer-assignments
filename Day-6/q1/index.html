        <h2>John Doe</h2>
        <p>I am a beginner learning HTML and CSS. I enjoy creating simple web pages
            and improving my coding skills step by step. I am currently practicing how
            to build small UI components like cards, buttons, and layouts. My goal is 
            to become confident in web development through continuous learning.</p>
