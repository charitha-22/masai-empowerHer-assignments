# Understanding Project Management in NodeJS

This document explains basic project management concepts in **Node.js** in simple terms with clear examples.

---

## a. Package Managers

### What is a package manager?

A **package manager** is a tool that helps developers **install, update, remove, and manage external libraries (packages)** required in a project.

Example:
Instead of writing everything from scratch (like authentication, validation, logging), we use ready-made packages.

---

### Why do we need package managers in backend development?

Backend applications depend on many third-party libraries. Package managers help to:

* Download required libraries easily
* Manage project dependencies automatically
* Maintain correct versions of libraries
* Save development time

Example:
For creating APIs, instead of writing a server from scratch, we use **Express.js** installed via a package manager.

---

### Problems faced if package managers are not used

If package managers are not used:

* Manual downloading of libraries becomes difficult
* Version mismatches may break the application
* Dependency tracking becomes impossible
* Sharing projects with others becomes hard
* Project setup takes more time

---

## b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

### What is NPM?

**NPM** stands for **Node Package Manager**. It is the default package manager that comes with Node.js.

It allows developers to:

* Install Node.js libraries
* Manage dependencies
* Run project scripts

---

### Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?

NPM is important because:

* It provides access to thousands of open-source packages
* It manages dependencies efficiently
* It ensures consistent project setup across different systems
* It simplifies project maintenance

---

### How NPM helps in managing dependencies

NPM tracks dependencies in a file called **package.json**.

When you run:

```
npm install express
```

* Express is downloaded
* Entry is added to `package.json`
* Version is locked in `package-lock.json`

This ensures the same versions are installed everywhere.

---

## c. Backend Project Initialization

### Command used to initialize a backend (Node.js) project

```
npm init
```

---

### Explanation of npm init and npm init -y

#### npm init

* Asks a series of questions (project name, version, description, etc.)
* Creates a `package.json` file based on user input

#### npm init -y

* Skips all questions
* Creates `package.json` with default values
* Faster way to initialize a project

---

## d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

### package.json

**Purpose:**

* Stores project metadata
* Lists dependencies and scripts

**Importance:**

* Acts as the heart of a Node.js project
* Required to install dependencies

---

### node_modules

**Purpose:**

* Contains all installed dependencies

**Importance:**

* Required for the application to run
* Automatically generated by NPM

---

### package-lock.json

**Purpose:**

* Locks exact versions of installed packages

**Importance:**

* Ensures consistent installations across systems
* Improves reliability and performance

---

## GitHub Best Practices

### Files/Folders that should NOT be pushed to GitHub

* `node_modules/`

**Why?**

* Very large in size
* Can be regenerated using `npm install`

---

### Files that MUST be committed to GitHub

* `package.json`
* `package-lock.json`

**Why?**

* Required to install dependencies
* Ensures consistent project setup for all developers
